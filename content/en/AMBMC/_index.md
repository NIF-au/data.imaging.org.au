## Our Objectives
The Australian Mouse Brain Mapping Consortium (AMBMC) aims to provide researchers with access to a national facility to characterise their mouse models of neurological disease. The AMBMC will use state-of-the-art imaging, computational anatomy and image analysis to enable multi-dimensional statistical comparisons of brain anatomy between the mouse model and background strain. The AMBMC was funded by an National Health and Medical Research Council Enabling Grant (436673).
